# Runway Example go App

This is an example app demonstrating how to deploy a go app
to [runway](https://runway.planetary-quantum.com/).

* clone this repo, and navigate into that directory
* `runway app create`
* `runway app deploy`
* `runway open`

You can then deploy changes by `git commit`ing them, and running `runway app
deploy` again.

The Makefile in here is for local use, and not used or needed by runway.
